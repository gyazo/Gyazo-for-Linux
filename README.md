#### Change your Screenshot Command/Tool

Gyazo uses the `import` (imagemagick) command/tool by default. If you have trouble using Gyazo when taking screenshots, such as it not taking the correct area, a broken image being taken, or something irregular, try changing your screenshot tool following these steps before submitting an Issue.

Change screenshot command with `$HOME/.gyazo.config.yml`, as shown below.

- `scrot`

```yaml
command: scrot -s
```

- `gnome-screenshot`

```yaml
command: gnome-screenshot -a -f
```

- `xfce4-screenshooter`

```yaml
command: xfce4-screenshooter -r -o gyazo
```

- [Other Screenshot Tools](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Taking_a_screenshot)

#### Stop opening new browser tab

Add the following line to `$HOME/.gyazo.config.yml`:

```yaml
browser_cmd: echo
```
